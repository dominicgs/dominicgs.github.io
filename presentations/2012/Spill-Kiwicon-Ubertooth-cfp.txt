Title: Bluetooth sniffing with Ubertooth

Length: 45mins

Abstract:
Bluetooth traffic analysis is hard.  While 802.11 and Zigbee have promiscuous
mode on commodity hardware, Bluetooth packet sniffing is hampered by
pseudo-random frequency hopping between packets as well as data whitening,
integrity and CRC checks based on unknown device state.

Using entirely open source hardware and software, we are now able to calculate
the internal state from received packet and hop frequency 1600 times per second
to monitor the connection between arbitrary devices.

Demos - finding non-discoverable devices, recovering internal device state,
sniffing packets, Bluetooth low energy sniffing if time allows (and if I can
find some devices).

Ancestry:
Dominic has been trying to build a promiscuous Bluetooth sniffer since 2007,
so we can assume it's hard.  In July 2012 he took over as lead developer on
project Ubertooth in an attempt to add features such as frequency hopping.
This talk shows the fruits of that work.
